# Domain Model

This doc names the core concepts and ownership boundaries for the domain.

## Contract

- The repo owns versioned baseline packs and semantic classifiers; tenant enablement and configuration live in control9.
- Baseline packs cover IAM expansion, new roles, cross-account access, destructive changes, network boundary changes, production target, secrets exposure hints, unapproved pipeline sources, cost thresholds, deploy verification mismatch, and off-path findings.

## Open implementation decisions

Implementation-level items not yet fully specified. `/refine-issue` resolves these into timeless contract prose and removes or collapses bullets when done.

### Control9 project plan
- Define baseline pack names, policy categories, decision reasons, severity/risk levels, managed-control packaging, and high-level exception semantics.
