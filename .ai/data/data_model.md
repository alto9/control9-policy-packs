# Data Model

This doc describes durable and transient data concepts without freezing physical table or field names.

## Contract

- Pack data includes readable policy documents, compiled artifacts, classifier metadata, fixture examples, version manifests, and compatibility metadata.
- Every decision carries enough policy metadata to explain the pack version, matched rule, risk summary, reason, and fixture coverage.

## Open implementation decisions

Implementation-level items not yet fully specified. `/refine-issue` resolves these into timeless contract prose and removes or collapses bullets when done.

### Control9 project plan
- Define policy pack manifest shape, classifier fixture format, compatibility metadata, example organization, and versioning rules.
